Working with PySpark for the last couple of years, I know that testing Spark locally can be challenging for both new and experienced data engineers.  
It‚Äôs not as simple as testing a regular Python function. PySpark code runs on a Spark cluster and deals with distributed processing.  
So setting up a Spark environment for tests ‚Äî and making assertions about distributed DataFrames ‚Äî is more complex than testing a plain Python function.  
On top of that, there‚Äôs often an implicit reliance on external data (reading from blob storage, S3, etc.), which is hard to reproduce in tests.

This post is a personal, experience-based tour. I‚Äôll often say ‚Äúwe,‚Äù reflecting on how my team and I approach testing PySpark jobs. If you have any remarks, don‚Äôt hesitate to add a comment below. üòâ

## First: Windows or Linux

As a long-time Windows user, I learned that PySpark isn‚Äôt Windows-friendly out of the box. You *can* make it work by configuring Hadoop and using `winutils`, but it‚Äôs a headache (and brittle).  
My strong recommendation: **use Docker or WSL2 for PySpark development on Windows**. It saves a lot of pain. As they say, *if a data tool works on Windows, it‚Äôs almost by accident‚Ä¶* Personally, I use WSL on Windows.

> Tip: If you stick with native Windows, expect to wrangle Java, `HADOOP_HOME`, and `winutils.exe`. With WSL2 or Docker, it ‚Äújust works,‚Äù and it‚Äôs closer to prod.

## Second: How you should (probably) structure your ETL code

It goes without saying (right?) that you should **separate I/O, Spark session config, and business logic**. That usually means using dependency injection for the Spark session and keeping transformations pure.

A typical business-logic function should look like this:

```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

def transform_data(df):
    cleaned = (
        df.filter(F.col("active") == True)
          .withColumn("name", F.initcap("name"))
          .withColumn("signup_year", F.year("signup_date"))
    )
    agg = cleaned.groupBy("signup_year").count()
    return agg
````

Notice how `transform_data` is self-contained. It doesn‚Äôt create a Spark session or read/write files. It just takes a DataFrame and returns a DataFrame.
This isolation is golden for testing ‚Äî we can feed in a tiny DataFrame and check the output without worrying about external I/O. It also follows functional principles: given the same input, you get the same output, with no side effects.

> Quick anti-pattern: avoid putting `spark = SparkSession.builder...` or file I/O *inside* transformation functions. Keep extract/transform/load separate.

## Third: We‚Äôre there ‚Äî how we test Spark jobs!

I‚Äôve seen a few approaches, but these two are the most common. Note that PySpark doesn‚Äôt ship a special testing framework, though since Spark 3.4 there are helpful assertions we can reuse.

### 1. With `unittest` classes

A common pattern is to create **one** Spark session for the whole test class. `unittest` provides `setUpClass` / `tearDownClass` for this.

```python
import unittest
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.testing.utils import assertDataFrameEqual  # Spark 3.4+

# from your code
from libs.transformations import transform_data

class SparkETLTests(unittest.TestCase):
    # Initialize one SparkSession for all tests (keeps tests fast)
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.spark = (
            SparkSession.builder
            .appName("PySparkETLTests")
            .master("local[2]")
            .getOrCreate()
        )

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        cls.spark.stop()

    def test_transform_basic(self):
        # Arrange
        sample_data = [
            {"name": "alice",   "signup_date": "2020-01-01", "active": True},
            {"name": "bob",     "signup_date": "2021-03-15", "active": True},
            {"name": "charlie", "signup_date": "2020-07-23", "active": False},
        ]
        input_df = self.spark.createDataFrame(sample_data)

        # Act
        result_df = transform_data(input_df)

        # Assert: one row per signup_year for active users
        expected_data = [
            {"signup_year": 2020, "count": 1},
            {"signup_year": 2021, "count": 1},
        ]
        expected_df = self.spark.createDataFrame(expected_data)

        assertDataFrameEqual(
            result_df.orderBy("signup_year"),
            expected_df.orderBy("signup_year"),
        )

        # For older Spark versions:
        # self.assertEqual(sorted(result_df.collect()), sorted(expected_df.collect()))
```

> You don‚Äôt need to mimic full ‚Äúproduction-like‚Äù DataFrames with dozens of columns if the function needs only a few. Early on we dumped prod samples into tests (don‚Äôt do this ‚Äî security, flakiness, and slow tests). Keep unit tests synthetic and tiny.

### 2. With `pytest`

Same idea, but using a reusable fixture:

```python
import pytest
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def spark():
    spark = (
        SparkSession.builder
        .appName("PySparkTests")
        .master("local[2]")
        .getOrCreate()
    )
    yield spark
    spark.stop()

def test_something(spark):
    df = spark.createDataFrame([("A", 1)], ["k", "v"])
    assert df.count() == 1
```

## Patterns and anti-patterns for PySpark unit tests

After writing a bunch of tests, I've collected some best practices that I live by:

* **Use small, in-memory data.** Create inputs with `createDataFrame` from lists of dicts/tuples. If you need to test CSV parsing, consider `io.StringIO` or a tiny file under `tests/test_data`. Generally, file I/O belongs to integration tests; unit tests focus on transformations.

* **Don‚Äôt share state across tests.** Each test sets up its own inputs/expected outputs. Reusing a mutated DataFrame across tests causes ghost failures.

* **Beware of DataFrame ordering.** DataFrames are unordered. Sort before comparing (e.g., `orderBy`) or compare as collections.

* **Assert schema when it matters.** If you add/remove/change columns, assert that (`assertSchemaEqual` in Spark 3.4+, or check `df.schema`/types explicitly).

* **Performance sanity checks (lightweight).** Unit tests are for correctness, but you can catch regressions indirectly. If a transform is supposed to filter rows, assert `result.count() < input.count()`.

* **About UDFs:** Prefer built-in functions (`when`, `regexp_replace`, `concat_ws`, window functions, etc.). If a UDF is truly necessary, **isolate the Python logic** in a pure function, unit-test it directly, then wrap it as a UDF. Also make UDFs null-safe (`if x is None: return None`) to avoid surprises.

* **Nulls and edge cases.** Write at least one test with nulls, unexpected values, or missing columns. Decide whether to fail fast (raise) or coerce, and lock that behavior in a test.

## Wrapping up

Think about what could go wrong in your data: nulls, unexpected values, duplicates, timezone-weird timestamps, schema drifts, etc. Write a tiny test for each. It feels like overkill at first, but each test is only a few lines and can save you from a nasty production bug.

Thanks for reading ‚Äî hope this saves you some debugging time.
