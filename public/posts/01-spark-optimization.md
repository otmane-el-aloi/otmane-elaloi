Apache Spark is powerful, but without careful tuning, your jobs can run longer (and cost more) than they should.  
Here are **five practical techniques** I’ve used to speed up Spark workloads in production.

---

## 1. Use the Right File Format
- **Prefer Parquet or Delta** over CSV/JSON for analytical queries.
- They’re columnar, compressed, and support predicate pushdown.

```scala
df.write.format("delta")
  .mode("overwrite")
  .save("/mnt/data/events_delta")
````

---

## 2. Partition Data Strategically

* **Too few partitions** → under-utilized cores.
* **Too many partitions** → overhead in task scheduling.

> Rule of thumb: target 2–4× the number of executor cores.

```scala
val optimizedDF = df.repartition(200, col("event_date"))
```

---

## 3. Cache and Persist Wisely

Only cache datasets reused **multiple times** in your workflow.

```scala
val enriched = transformData(raw).cache()
// use enriched multiple times...
```

Remember to `unpersist()` when done.

---

## 4. Avoid Shuffles Where Possible

Shuffles are expensive!

* Use `broadcast()` for small lookup tables.
* Filter early to reduce data movement.

```scala
val lookupSmall = spark.read.parquet("/mnt/lookups/countries")
val joined = largeDF.join(broadcast(lookupSmall), "country_code")
```

---

## 5. Monitor and Iterate

Use the **Spark UI** to:

* Spot skewed stages.
* Find long-running tasks.
* Adjust configuration iteratively.

Key configs to try:

```text
spark.sql.shuffle.partitions
spark.executor.memory
spark.executor.cores
```

---

### Final Thoughts

Optimization isn’t one-size-fits-all. Profile your jobs, experiment with parameters, and measure the results.
